# What you learned about Linear Regression
--> i learned Linear Regression tells the rate of change of a parameter when another parameter changes.

# What you learned about Ridge & Lasso
--> I learned that Ridge(L1) regression is used to reduce the deviated plot to almost zero but not zero. Lasso(L2) regression is used to reduce the deviated plot to zero.

# One area you feel confident in
--> i feel confident in file handling and manual linear regression.

# One area you feel you could strengthen
--> i feel i could strengthen at types of regressions like Ridge(L1) and Lasso(L2)regression.

# One question you have (optional)
--> Why regression is important to understand instead of other concepts?

# What you want to improve next week
--> I want to improve the practical implementation of concepts/algorithm and ability to write code by myself by understanding the essence of concepts/algorithms.
